**Counting number of bears using for loop** 

```javascript
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  /*first section contains code before loop, second section contains
  condition so it will happen (also can be considered as limit in this case, third section condition
  once after iteration of loop*/
  
		for(int i = 1; i < 6; i = i + 1 ) { 
			System.out.println(i + "bear");
		}
	}
}
```
